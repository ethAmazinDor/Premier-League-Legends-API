# Premier-League-Legends-API
an API that contains information on the top premier league legends

#What I learned
- Learned how to create my own api using Node.js and Express
- Learned about cors npm package to allow API calls from localhost
- Learned how to serve static files within my project using express.static()

#Whats Next
- To build a front end application that allows users to type in a name of their favorite premier league legend and get back data of their stats and trophies throughout their career in football.
- Use node.js and express to build my own server that will allow me to fetch data from my API
